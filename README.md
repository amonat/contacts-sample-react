# Contact Sample React Application

This is a sample single-page application for managing contacts built in React.

The application allows creating contacts with the following fields:
1. First name
1. Last name
1. Email address
1. Phone number
1. Status - active or inactive

All fields are required except phone number, which is optional. No validations are done on the contents of any field.

The application supports the following features:
1. All contacts are listed, in the order they were created.
1. A new contact can be added and saved.
1. An existing contact can be edited, including changing its status between active and inactive and vice versa.
1. A contact can be deleted.

Note that contacts are not saved beyond the current page load, making the application unsuitable for storing contacts (see potential extesnsions section below).

# Potential extensions
The application only supports a basic set of functionality. Possible extensions include:
1. Persisting contacts, either to a server or to local storage.
1. Adding more validations, such as some checking that email addresses are valid, and possibly integrating a service for auto-checking for misspelled email domain names.
1. Better styling.
1. Different user interaction patterns for activating/deactivating and for deleting, say by adding a confirmation step or the ability to un-delete.

# Auto-generated instructions for running the application

Below are the instructions for running the application and its tests. They were generated by the create-react-app tools; I have left them unchanged.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
